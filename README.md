# eigen3_document_to_CN
Eigen3 provides a tgz archive of its document for offline reading. I think it will be a meaningful work to translate the content in .html files to Chinese.On one hand, it will help to construct clear understanding of eigen3's functions and detailes.On the other hand,it will offer more convenience for new users.

The original webpage is: https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/index.html

There are some principles of translation:
1. Retain The English associated with eigen library code.
2. Keep English words you don't understand indeed.
3. Keep English words that cannot be expressed in short Chinese.
